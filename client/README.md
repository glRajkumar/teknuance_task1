### Trello clone
trello like website for handling tasks

### dnd feature
for drag and drop, I used react-smooth-dnd package.

### Client folder structure
Every files are arranged by their use.
All task related js files are separated in Boards folder.

### User guide to use the website

2) home page have all the boards created by him/her self

3) some main links are in the profile mini section

4) User can create a board in CreateBoard section with some catageries.
(for very catagery, board name should be unique)

5) User can then go to the specific board page

6) In board section, User can add title according to their status.

7) User can go to the detailed page onclicking the title

8) Public boards are read only. All boards are private by default.
